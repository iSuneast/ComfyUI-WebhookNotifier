# ComfyUI-WebhookNotifier

Webhook notification plugin for ComfyUI, used to send webhook notifications when image generation is completed.

## Features

- Automatically sends webhook notifications after generating images
- Supports custom JSON data in notifications
- Simple to use, just connect to the image output

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to ComfyUI's `custom_nodes` directory:

```bash
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/iSuneast/ComfyUI-WebhookNotifier.git
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Restart ComfyUI service

## Usage

The plugin provides a Webhook Notifier node that can be connected to image output to send notifications when generation is complete.

Parameter description:
- `images`: Input images (required, connect to the output of an image generation node)
- `webhook_url`: Webhook URL address (required, default is "https://example.com/webhook")
- `additional_info`: Additional information in JSON format (optional, default is empty)

## Webhook Notification Format

The WebhookNotifier node sends the contents of the `additional_info` parameter as the JSON payload. **Note that the image data itself is not included in the webhook payload**. The node only requires the image input to trigger the notification when image generation is complete.

For example, if you provide the following in the additional_info field:

```json
{
  "status": "completed",
  "custom_field1": "Custom value 1",
  "custom_field2": "Custom value 2"
}
```

This exact JSON will be sent to the webhook URL. If the additional_info field is left empty or contains invalid JSON, an empty JSON object `{}` will be sent.

## Example

Connect the output of an image generation node to the WebhookNotifier node's images input, set your webhook URL, and optionally provide additional information in JSON format. When image generation is complete, the node will send a POST request to the specified webhook URL with your custom data.

## Debugging

The node prints debug information to the console, including whether the webhook notification was sent successfully:
- "Webhook notification started in background" when the webhook thread is started
- "Webhook notification successful: [status code]" for successful requests
- "Webhook notification failed: [status code] - [response text]" for failed requests
- "Error sending webhook: [error message]" for exceptions
- "Error preparing webhook: [error message]" if there are errors before sending
